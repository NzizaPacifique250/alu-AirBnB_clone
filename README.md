# AirBnB Clone Project

Welcome to the AirBnB Clone project! This is an intensive, multi-part project that will span over some days , where we will build our own version of the popular web application, AirBnB.

## Overview

This project will introduce we to key concepts in web development, including:

- **Backend Development**
- **Frontend Development**
- **Database Management**
- **Web Deployment**
- **API Integration**

By the end of this project, we will have built a fully functional web application that clones the core features of AirBnB.

## Project Components

The project is divided into several key parts:

### 1. Console
The first part of the project involves building a command-line interface (CLI) that will manage our application. we will:
- Create, update, and delete objects
- Learn about file serialization
- Build the first version of the storage engine using **file storage**.

### 2. HTML/CSS
In this phase, we will learn the basics of **HTML** and **CSS** to create a visual interface for our application. we will be responsible for making our application look appealing and user-friendly.

### 3. MySQL
This part introduces we to **MySQL** databases, where we'll explore a more advanced way of storing and managing data. we will:
- Replace file storage with **MySQL storage**.
- Learn best practices for efficient data management.

### 4. Deployment with Fabric
After building our app, we'll learn how to deploy it to a server using **Fabric**, a Python library that simplifies application deployment. This phase will teach we how to:
- Host our application on a remote server.
- Manage deployment workflows.

### 5. Flask Web Application
we'll move into building a web server using **Flask**. In this part, we'll:
- Build a web application server to handle requests.
- Connect the backend logic to our HTML templates, making the website dynamic and interactive.

### 6. RESTful API
Next, we'll develop a **REST API** that will expose our backend models as **JSON** data. we will:
- Create routes to handle various API calls.
- Learn how to structure our data and send it between the client and server in JSON format.

### 7. Web Dynamic
In the final phase, we'll integrate the **REST API** with our frontend, making our application truly dynamic. we will:
- Fetch data from the API and display it on the frontend.
- Ensure our web application is interactive, responsive, and ready to be shared with other users.

## What we Will Learn

Through this project, we will:
- Gain hands-on experience with **object-oriented programming**, **web frameworks** (Flask), **front-end development**, **databases**, and **deployment**.
- Understand how the various components of a full-stack web application come together.
- Develop skills in debugging, testing, and deploying web applications.

## How to Get Started

1. Clone the repository:

   **SSH**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:NzizaPacifique250/alu-AirBnB_clone.git
   ```
   **HTTPS**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NzizaPacifique250/alu-AirBnB_clone.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the console to interact with the app's backend:
   ```bash
   ./console.py
   ```

## Enjoy the Journey!
