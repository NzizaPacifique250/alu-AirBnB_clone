# üè° AirBnB Clone 

## Project Description
This project is the first step in building a full AirBnB web application. It involves creating a **command interpreter** to manage AirBnB objects, which will be expanded in future stages. The command interpreter allows for the **creation**, **retrieval**, **update**, and **deletion** of objects, as well as **storing** and **retrieving** data from a file in JSON format.

## Features
- **BaseModel**: A parent class that handles object initialization, serialization, and deserialization.
- **File Storage**: A storage engine that saves and loads objects from JSON files.
- **AirBnB Classes**: Core models including `User`, `State`, `City`, `Place`, and more, which inherit from `BaseModel`.
- **Command Interpreter**: Provides commands like `create`, `show`, `update`, `destroy`, and `all` for object management.
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive tests to validate the functionality of models and the storage engine.
